# C02-Emissions-Interactive-Python-Dashboard
C02 Emissions Interactive visualization dashboard coded in Python and visualized with Panel libraries

The dataset is from Our World in Data and the dataset is on greenhouse gas emissions. We explored this data to identify different insights into the impact and levels of CO2 that have been directly affecting global warming. Human emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary driver of climate change today

The interactive panel is generated when accessed through 
> "panel serve C02_Emissions_Interactive_Python_Dashboard.ipynb" in the terminal.

This project is where I am creating an interactive dashboard with python. I plan to understand the CO2  data from Our World in Data and create charts that reflect the circumstances of CO2 emissions and how they may affect climate change. I have three varieties of visualization; showing the comparisons between CO2 Emissions, countries, continents and the CO2 sources. I used panel, hvplot and python data science libraries to build this dashboard. I am still working on this project since it's a practice project to showcase my skills.
