# C02-Emissions-Interactive-Python-Dashboard
C02 Emissions Interactive visualization dashboard coded in Python and visualized with Panel libraries

The dataset is from Our World in Data and the dataset is on greenhouse gas emissions. We explored this data to identify different insights into the impact and levels of CO2 that have been directly affecting global warming. Human emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary driver of climate change today

The interactive panel is generated when accessed through 
> "panel serve C02_Emissions_Interactive_Python_Dashboard.ipynb" in the terminal.

The data was cleaned and processed before it was used to build the different elements of the interactive panel. Then they were put together to produce the final interactive panel.
